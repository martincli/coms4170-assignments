Assignment #3: Gestural Video Player

Assignment
----------
Copied from the original assignment text:
    You will be designing, building, and documenting, by yourself, an application that uses one of the gesture recognizers that is referenced on the webpage for the $1 unistroke gesture recognizer. Your application will be a video player whose functionality is provided by the HTML5 <video> element. User interaction with your player should be done entirely by gestures (i.e., without the need for buttons, sliders, keyboards, or the controls attribute). You should support play, pause, seek (i.e., setting the currentTime attribute), and control of the playbackRate, volume, muted, width, and height attributes. Interaction with your video player should be performed using gestures whose templates you define yourself (instead of using the set of templates defined in the original source code for the recognizer you have chosen).

Running
-------
To run the application, simply download the files and open index.html in a browser (tested with Chrome).
